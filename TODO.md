# TODOs

## Tasks

- motivate the thesis again

- stay focused!
- explain whats needed for the next chapters in detail

## Open Issues

- provide more (improved, rigorous) definitions
    - capability-oblivious code
    - mem safety: see ISAv8 guide 2.4.2
- define exactly what and where the TCB is
- CubicleOS does not require extra support from the OS and compiler (unlike CHERI)
- sentry = sealed entry
- look again at jump-based invocation mechanism (unsealing just 1 cap)
- rereads ARMv8-A Procedure Call Standard (calling convention)
- add to sources: <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/workshops/2016eurosys/>
- maybe look at CheriFreeRTOS
- bring order to "Download" dir and images on the home screen
