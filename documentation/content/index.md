## :page_with_curl: About

This is a personal documentation about ARM. The information is mostly taken from the [ARM Developer Documentation], but other sources are used as well. The documentation is built with [MkDocs Material] and deployed on [GitHub Pages].

[ARM Developer Documentation]: https://developer.arm.com/documentation/
[MkDocs Material]: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/
[GitHub Pages]: https://pages.github.com/

??? info ":bookmark: Further Reading"

    This documentation is a "meta-documentation" as it is based on other documentations and sources. Here are a few of them:

    1. [Ask development questions and find articles and blogs on specific topics from Arm experts](https://community.arm.com/)
    3. [Arm Architecture and Processor Manuals](https://developer.arm.com/)
    4. [Arm Docs - LtA - Introducing the Arm Architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102404/0201?lang=en)
    5. [Arm Docs - LtA - Guides](https://www.arm.com/architecture/learn-the-architecture/)
    6. [Arm Docs - LtA - Exception Model](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102412/0103)
    7. [Arm Docs - LtA - AArch64 Virtualization](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102142/latest)
    8. [Arm Docs - LtA - TrustZone for AArch64](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102418/0101)

    Moreover, each Arm

    - **Architecture Reference Manual** describes an architecture specification. An Arm Architecture Reference Manual is relevant to any implementation of that architecture.
    - Cortex processor has a **Technical Reference Manual** (TRM). A TRM describes the features specific to that processor. In general, TRMs do not repeat any information given in the Arm Architecture Reference Manuals.
    - Cortex processor also has a Configuration and Integration Manual (CIM). The CIM describes how to integrate the processor into a system. Generally, this information is only relevant to SoC designers.

## :bulb: Motivation

Navigating a large field of study can be cumbersome at times. Having valuable information in one place that is easily navigatable makes things easier. This documentation is for the work I do and tailored to this specific use case. I made it public because others may be able to benefit from this documentation as well.
