## :page_with_curl: About

This is a personal documentation about ARM. The information is mostly taken from the [ARM Developer Documentation], but other sources are used as well. The documentation is built with [MkDocs Material] and deployed on [GitHub Pages].

## :bulb: Motivation

Navigating a large field of study can be cumbersome at times. Having valuable information in one place that is easily navigatable makes things easier. This documentation is for the work I do and tailored to this specific use case. I made it public because others may be able to benefit from this documentation as well.
