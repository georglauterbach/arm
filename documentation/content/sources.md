## More About Arm

Each Arm

- **Architecture Reference Manual** describes an architecture specification. An Arm Architecture Reference Manual is relevant to any implementation of that architecture.
- Cortex processor has a **Technical Reference Manual** (TRM). A TRM describes the features specific to that processor. In general, TRMs do not repeat any information given in the Arm Architecture Reference Manuals.
- Cortex processor also has a Configuration and Integration Manual (CIM). The CIM describes how to integrate the processor into a system. Generally, this information is only relevant to SoC designers.
